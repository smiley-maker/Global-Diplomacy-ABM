# Global-Diplomacy-ABM
Global-Diplomacy-ABM is an agent-based simulation that models the evolution of international diplomatic relations using historical data from 1960 to 2020. The project leverages network science and computational modeling to explore how alliances form, evolve, and dissolve over time, providing insights into the dynamics of global diplomacy.
